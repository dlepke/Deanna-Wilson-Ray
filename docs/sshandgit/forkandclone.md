# Forking and Cloning Repositories using SSH Keys

To clone a repository from GitHub using SSH Keys, first go to the repository your wish to clone, which should look something like this: ![](/assets/images/github%20repo.png)

From here, click on the green code button, highlighted below, and select the "SSH" option from the dropdown list. ![](/assets/images/SSH%20option.png)

In this window, click the double windowed copy symbol, as indicated in the picture below, or highlight the link and copy it by pressing and holding down the "ctrl" key and then pressing the "c" key. ![](/assets/images/copy%20github%20link.png)

Once you have copied the link, you can now clone the repository using the link and your method of choice, such as PyCharm or the command line.
