Greetings, User!

The purpose of this guide is to assist you with setting up an SSH key with your Github account so that you can easily push your work to the repository. No need for the hassle of tokens that may expire or be forgotten!

## Intended Users {#Intended-Users}
This guide is for:
* Beginner or Intermediate level coders with a basic knowledge of their computer's command-line interface.
* Individuals with little to no knowledge of what "SSH" is and how to set it up on a local device.

### Prerequisite Knowledge {#Prerequisite-Knowledge}
This guide is for users that have:
* Git already set up on their workstations
* Github accounts already set up
* a basic understanding of the command line interface for the Git version control tool

### Software Requirements {#Software-Requirements}
Prior to using this guide, please make sure that you have the newest version of Git installed on your device. If you aren't sure, you can check which version you have by entering "git --version" (without the double quotes) on your machine's command-line interface. If you need to do a fresh install of Git, you can find the latest version here:

* [For Windows users](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Procedures Overview {#Procedures-Overview}
The main sections of the documentation are as follows:
* Setting Up GitHub SSH Key
* Cloning A Repo From The Command Line
* Pushing Changes To GitHub

### Why Use SSH? {#Why-Use-SSH}
These days, passwords can be easy to forget, hard to remember, and require constant updates if and when a data breach occurs. To avoid the issues a compromised password can cause, Github users are able to create what are known as "SSH key pairs" that provide a secure, reliable way to authenticate a user's credentials.

While setting up an SSH key pair is more time intensive then regular username/password combinations, the end result is an SSH key that is more secure than a password and less vulnerable to compromise. This guide aims to make the process simple and get you contributing to projects on GitHub in no time.
