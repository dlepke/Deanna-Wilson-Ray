Greetings, User!

The purpose of this guide is to assist you with setting up an SSH key with your Github account so that you can easily push your work to the repository. No need for the hassle of tokens that may expire or be forgotten!

### Table of Contents

## Intended Users
This guide is for:
* Beginner or Intermediate level coders with a basic knowledge of their computer's command-line interface.
* Individuals with little to no knowledge of what "SSH" is and how to set it up on a local device.

### Prerequisite Knowledge
This guide is for users that have:
* Git already set up on their workstations
* Github accounts already set up
* a basic understanding of the command line interface for the Git version control tool

### Software Requirements
Prior to using this guide, please make sure that you have the newest version of Git installed on your device. If you aren't sure, you can check which version you have by entering "git --version" (without the double quotes) on your machine's command-line interface. If you need to do a fresh install of Git, you can find the latest version here:
* [For Mac users](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
* [For Windows users](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Procedures Overview
The main sections of the documentation are as follows:
* Setting Up GitHub SSH Key
* Cloning A Repo From The Command Line
* Pushing Changes To GitHub

### Why Use SSH?
These days, passwords can be easy to forget, hard to remember, and require constant updates if and when a data breach occurs. To avoid the issues a compromised password can cause, Github users are able to create what are known as "SSH key pairs" that provide a secure, reliable way to authenticate a user's credentials.

While setting up an SSH key pair is more time intensive then regular username/password combinations, the end result is an SSH key that is more secure than a password and less vulnerable to compromise. This guide aims to make the process simple and get you contributing to projects on GitHub in no time.

## Conclusion
We felt that GitHub SSH was a safer, more user friendly alternative to using GitHub tokens, and thus endeavered to create this document to confer to you our knowledge of GitHub SSH.

Though we are by no means experts in the topic, we hope that our efforts prove useful to anyone who comes across these instructions looking for insight into the inner workings and nuances of GitHub SSH.

Regardless of what knowledge you may have obtained from these pages, our writing of this has also provided to us the opportunity to practice creating clear and precise user instructions for our target audience. This assignment also helped us learn to better work with our peers, strengthening our teamwork and communication skills. And as such, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for being here to witness the fruits of our labour.

We hope that this guide is able to assist you in setting up and working with SSH. While SSH may appear complex, it is actually a much simpler system once you get to know it, and its added security measures will ultimately result in a much smoother workflow experience with both Git and GitHub.
